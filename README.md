# Compass
A simple & straightforward, no-BS compass app that works with your Material You colors!

## Motivation
I do security work as a fourth job and having a proper compass helps. I tried
finding a good option on the Play Store but they all contain ads or shill other
apps. I just needed something that'd give me a general direction and (when I
need it) my exact bearing, so that's why I made this. I also made it draw colors
from your Material You theme so it looks amazing!

## Screenshots
Coming soon

## Installation
I'll be putting the app on the Play store shortly. For now, you can clone this
repo and build it as usual with Android Studio.
